      <p className="me">
        In my previous role, I worked on media campaigns covering topics from women‚Äôs health to employment rights, before becoming more interested in what my tech colleagues were doing: building new features and making bugs vanish. After trying out Python via Udemy, I applied to General Assembly‚Äôs Software Engineering Immersive. I am now looking for an entry-level role to channel my boundless enthusiasm for solving problems and trying out new things, and to build on the skills taught on the course.

      <p className="me">  At work I am happiest learning and tearing up completed to-do lists. The rest of the time I am happy whenever I am reading, somewhere hot and sunny (ideally by the sea), in the steep seats at the Royal Albert Hall or dining very casually. üçü
